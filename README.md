<b>BUSINESS PROBLEM GOALS</b>
1. Business Problem Understanding:
Every business depends on customer satisfaction and the Airline industry runs on the same 
model. Customer satisfaction depends on various factors of the airlines such as satisfaction 
level in the food, drinks, online boarding, etc. Our approach to the business problem is to find 
out the factors which directly influence customer satisfaction. Main goal for the business is to 
minimize the influence/occurrences of negative factors that affect customer satisfaction.

2. Business Objective:
<ul>
<li>Main objective of business is to make sure every customer using airline service is 
satisfied at the end of the day.</li>
<li>Determining the factors that are directly affecting the customer satisfaction and 
increasing the satisfaction level of these factors overall, so that the customer is satisfied 
Improve customer engagement indirectly, resulting in higher customer satisfaction.</li>
</ul>

3. Approach:
<ul>
<li>Exploratory Data Analysis</li>
<li>For prediction of Customer Satisfaction: Logistic Regression/Decision Tree based 
Classification/Na√Øve Bayes Classification</li>
</ul>

<b>TOPIC SURVEY IN BRIEF</b>
1. Problem understanding:
We have 22 attributes in this dataset that define customers' broad variety of options for selecting 
airlines based on their needs. If the passenger is dissatisfied as a result of the bad encounter, the 
passenger will hesitate in booking future flights and will most likely switch to another airline. 
This kind of thing happens all the time in the passenger airline industry. In today's competitive 
atmosphere, passenger satisfaction is one of the most important assets needed in the airline 
industry. Customer satisfaction analysis in airlines has grown in recent years, owing to the 
importance of providing high-quality service in airlines.

2. Current solution to the problem:
In the airline industry, a variety of studies on service quality hypotheses and approaches have 
been performed. In contrast, most recent airline studies have focused on the impact of airline 
service quality at the aggregate build stage, relying primarily on customer satisfaction and service 
quality to explain passenger analysis of services. The different airline companies are using some 
unforeseen methods to analyze customer satisfaction. And they are maintaining the data related to 
the customer satisfaction, in terms of services offered, availed by the customers and the reviews
The airlines are facing challenges in providing similar kind of services for both the business and 
economy classes flights.

3. Proposed solution to the problem: 
Numerous factors can aid an airline's customer base growth, and passenger service and 
satisfaction can be a deciding factor in the operation's overall success. We are building a machine 
learning based solution which involves Supervised Learning classification algorithms to predict 
the satisfaction of customers upon taking a flight in the airline considering various features.
